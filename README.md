1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.
What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Answer:
i think i try to write things in the easiest formaat. i find myself having a hard time grasping the materials so im always in need of help. I try to leave comments as 
well so i know whats going on. i think this could be used in a futre project because it uses bacis CRUD function which can be used alot. you may just have to change some of the code to 
fit what you are using for.
2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
ANSWER:
I try to look at what the requirements are and see how i can get to the solution. i try to think of how the end product should be and then
try and work my way back. im still very new to this so im sure there are alternate methods but thats a way that i was told. In the future i would surely try to keep eveything neat 
organized.
3.What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
ANSWER:
Computers scientist make sure thing are funtioning the way they should when it related to computing. they try to come up with simple methods to solve complex issues.
Now adays everything is ran by computers so computer scientist are needed more than ever. We need people who know how to do these things because people safety
could come into play . Our work on a project like the Grazioso Salvare project could help them in real life because it helps them to do thier jobs faster and more efficiantly.
All the info they need is provided for them at a few clicks of a keyboard and mouse.
